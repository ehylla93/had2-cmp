Custom models

List of modified models in co-op mods and other mods for Hidden & Dangerous 2

These modified models are used in the actors.bin or scene2.bin of existing mods. For modified vehicles models,
the basic models in the actors.bin files are listed here.
Modified vehicle models need additional new models files with the same name and a prefix,
which must be in the models directory of a new mod.
Vehicles with own weapons need additional new models for these weapons. See model tutorials for more details

Basic model:
fr_sherman

Prefix-models:
cfr_sherman
DMfr_sherman
sfr_sherman

additional models for weapons:
fr_sherman_f01_00.4ds
fr_sherman_f01_00.5ds
fr_sherman_f02_00.4ds
fr_sherman_f02_00.5ds

Some modified models have own new textures that cannot be listed here.

In some mods, there are additional models attached to some vehicle models.
Open the actors.bin of the referring missions directory and look for the values and sectors.
Attached weapons need no own definition. Own definitions for those attached weapons would cause bugs.
Other attached models are just for the shape of the vehicle and are called hull models here.

Modified vehicles composed of multiple vehicle models like Bedford Flak, Ostwind Tank Africa,
Sherman with hatch place or coax may cause lags. Also not all functions might work properly after inserting
into the actors.bin. In this cause, export the vehicle definition from the original actors.bin
and use it for your new mod. 

If you change any model, please use other file names for the new models.
